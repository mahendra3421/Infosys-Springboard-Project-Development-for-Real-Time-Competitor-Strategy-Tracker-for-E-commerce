# 🚀 Real-Time Competitor Strategy Tracker for E-Commerce  
### Infosys Springboard | AI Internship Project

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Real-Time Competitor Strategy Tracker** is an AI-driven market intelligence system designed to monitor and analyze competitor pricing, product availability, customer sentiment, and promotional strategies across e-commerce platforms in real time.

By automating data collection and analysis, the system enables businesses to make **data-driven pricing and strategic decisions**, reduce manual monitoring effort, and respond quickly to dynamic market conditions.

This project was developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence Internship at Infosys Springboard**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

E-commerce markets are highly dynamic, with frequent changes in competitor prices and promotions.  
Manual competitor tracking is:
- Time-consuming  
- Error-prone  
- Not scalable  

There is a need for an **automated, real-time competitor intelligence system** that delivers actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

## 🏁 Project Objectives

- Automate competitor data collection  
- Track pricing, offers, and product availability  
- Analyze customer sentiment and market trends  
- Enable dynamic pricing strategies  
- Support real-time, data-driven business decisions

# 🚀 Milestone 4: Cross-Platform Integration & Notification System Deployment


### 🎯 Overview
Milestone 4 marks the transition from static data analysis to a Live Market Intelligence System. This phase focused on bridging two distinct web environments—the source catalog and a global market API—using Semantic Intelligence to ensure 100% product matching accuracy. The result is an automated agent that not only identifies price gaps but also generates a real-time competitive pricing strategy.

## 🧠 Core Intelligence: Semantic Embedding
The primary challenge of this milestone was the "Identity Problem": matching a book title from the source (which lacked standardized IDs) to a competitor’s ISBN-13 database.

- Vector Space Mapping
Instead of traditional keyword matching, I implemented the SentenceTransformer ('all-MiniLM-L6-v2') model.

The Logic: Book titles are converted into high-dimensional numerical vectors (Embeddings).
The Advantage: The AI "understands" that 'orange: The Complete Collection 1' and 'Orange (Complete Edition) Vol 1' are the same entity, even if the characters don't match exactly.
- Semantic Similarity Validation
Using util.cos_sim (Cosine Similarity), the agent calculates a confidence score between the source title and the Google Books database.
**
Threshold: A 70% similarity barrier was implemented. If the AI isn't at least 70% confident in the match, the record is discarded to prevent "Pricing Hallucinations."**
